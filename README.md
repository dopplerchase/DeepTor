# DeepTor
This repository is all the code for expanding upon the work by Dr. Lagerquist et al. (2020)&(2021). 

## Getting Started
1. In a terminal window, clone this repository to your local machine with the command
`git clone <repo-address>`.
2. Within the terminal, go to the top-level directory of your repository with cd.
3. If you do not have a prior ai2es python environment within miniconda, create one from the environment.yml file.
   Use the command `conda env create -f environment.yml`. Activate the environment by running `conda activate ai2es` or 
   `source activate ai2es`.
4. If you already have an ai2es environment (check by typing `conda info --envs`), you can update
   the environment with changes to the environment.yml file by running `conda env update -f environment.yml`.
